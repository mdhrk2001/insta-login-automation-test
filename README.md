# insta-login-automation-test
A Selenium-based automation script for testing Instagram login functionality using Java. This project automates the login process by simulating user interactions such as entering credentials, handling login errors, and verifying authentication success. It uses WebDriverManager (v5.9.2) to automatically manage browser drivers, eliminating the need for manual downloads.
